# FIZZ BUZZ TREE

Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree Set the values of each of the new nodes depending on the corresponding node value in the source tree.

## Challenge

Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both.
Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String. Return a new tree.
## Approach & Efficiency

Big O of time is O(h) or (height) because in the worst case, er have to search all the way down to a leaf, which will require searching through as many nodes as the tree is tall/ Big O of space is O(1) because during a search we are not allocating any additional space.
