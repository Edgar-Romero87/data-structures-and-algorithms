## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Methods for a Linked List:

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- Within your linked list class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty linked list should be created.
- Added append method, that allows user to add a given value to the end of a list.
- Added includes method that should return a boolean result depending on weather a value exists.
- Added toString method that returns a string representing all the values in the linked list.
- Added insertBefore method, allows a user to add a new value before pre-existing value.
- Added insertAfter method that adds a new node value after a node value.
- Added kthFromEnd method thats takes a number, `k`, as a parameter. Returns the node's value that is `k` from the en of the linked list.
- Added zip method that combines two linked list into one alternating list.


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- insert() O(1)
- includes() O(n)
- toString() O(n)
- append() O(n)
- insertBefore() O(n)
- insertAfter() O(n)
- kthFromEnd() O(n)
- zip() O(n)
